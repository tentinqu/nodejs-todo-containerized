# Contributing to Todo App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this todo app as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 License

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ajeetraina/todo-app-nodejs-docker/issues)
